# 🛰️ Obsygnal — Unified Observability Starts Here

> *One Signal. Infinite Clarity.*

Obsygnal is on a mission to **redefine observability** for modern engineering teams — starting with **infrastructure monitoring** for on-prem and cloud-hosted environments. As we grow, we’ll expand into APM, ML observability, and LLM intelligence — all under one elegant, performant, and secure umbrella.

This repository contains the **source code for the landing page** of Obsygnal. It’s designed to:
- Communicate our vision
- Collect early adopters via email capture
- Showcase upcoming features and architecture
- Set the tone with a futuristic, UX-first design

## 🧠 Why Obsygnal?

Today's observability stack is fragmented. You juggle:
- Cloud dashboards
- On-prem SNMP tools
- Prometheus for metrics
- APM tools that don't scale
- ML/LLM monitoring that feels duct-taped

We’re building **Obsygnal** to unify it all.
